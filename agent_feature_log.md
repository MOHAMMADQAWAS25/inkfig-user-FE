## Entries

### 2026-09-28 - Establish the React and Vite frontend foundation

- Added a strict TypeScript React application built with Vite, React Router page routing, and Lucide React icons.
- Added shared API request handling with separate user/main API base URLs, an authentication context, protected routes, permission helpers, and Arabic/English localization with automatic RTL/LTR document direction.
- Added a responsive application shell, mobile drawer, login foundation, dashboard placeholder, and shared Shadow-inspired CSS tokens for dark surfaces, subtle borders, orange actions, compact controls, and restrained status colors.
- Documented the frontend folder boundaries and prohibited unapproved UI/state libraries.
- Verification: 2 Node tests passed and the TypeScript/Vite production build passed. Automated checks cover responsive and RTL CSS markers; live browser visual inspection was unavailable in this session and remains required when feature UI is implemented.
