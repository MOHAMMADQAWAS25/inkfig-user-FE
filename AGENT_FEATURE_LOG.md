# Agent Feature Log

This file is the repository's running implementation history for agent-assisted work.

## Working rule

- Read this file before making any change in this repository.
- After completing work, add a dated entry describing what changed and how it was verified.
- State whether a database migration is required and name it when applicable.
- Keep entries concise, factual, and limited to this repository.

## Entries

### 2026-09-28 - Establish the React and Vite frontend foundation

- Added a strict TypeScript React application built with Vite, React Router page routing, and Lucide React icons.
- Added shared API request handling with separate user/main API base URLs, an authentication context, protected routes, permission helpers, and Arabic/English localization with automatic RTL/LTR document direction.
- Added a responsive application shell, mobile drawer, login foundation, dashboard placeholder, and shared Shadow-inspired CSS tokens for dark surfaces, subtle borders, orange actions, compact controls, and restrained status colors.
- Documented the frontend folder boundaries and prohibited unapproved UI/state libraries.
- Verification: 2 Node tests passed and the TypeScript/Vite production build passed. Automated checks cover responsive and RTL CSS markers; live browser visual inspection was unavailable in this session and remains required when feature UI is implemented.
- Migration required: No.

### 2026-09-28 - Document the InkFig product vision

## 2026-09-29 - Deploy the frontend from GitHub Actions

### Request

Automatically test, build, and deploy the frontend to Cloudflare whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch, alongside the existing backend deployment workflows.

### Changes

- Added a GitHub Actions workflow triggered by pushes to `main` and manual dispatches.
- Added deterministic dependency installation, frontend tests, strict TypeScript/Vite build, Cloudflare Worker deployment, and a production URL health check.
- Built the frontend with the production user and main API base URLs.
- Added Wrangler static-assets configuration for the existing `inkfig-user-fe` Worker.
- Enabled single-page-application fallback so React Router paths resolve to `index.html`.
- Serialized production deployments to prevent overlapping Worker updates.
- Documented the required Cloudflare account ID and scoped API-token secrets.
- Left application routes, UI behavior, authentication state, localization, and backend contracts unchanged.

### Repositories

- `inkfig-user-FE`: added automatic Cloudflare Worker deployment.
- `inkfig-user-system`: already contains its AWS deployment workflow; no changes in this ticket.
- `inkfig-main-system`: already contains its AWS deployment workflow; no changes in this ticket.

### Files

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: tests, builds, deploys, and health-checks the production frontend.
- `wrangler.jsonc`: configures the `inkfig-user-fe` Worker static assets and SPA fallback.
- `README.md`: documents production API URLs and Cloudflare GitHub secrets.
- `AGENT_FEATURE_LOG.md`: recorded this ticket.

### API

No API changes.

### Database

No migration required.

### Permissions and scope

- The workflow receives read-only repository contents and GitHub deployment-write permission.
- Cloudflare access is limited by the scope of `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`; it should grant only the Workers edit access required for the InkFig account.
- No application permissions, roles, or backend authorization changed.

### Frontend

- Builds with `VITE_USER_API_BASE_URL=https://user-api.inkfig-hu.com/api/v1`.
- Builds with `VITE_MAIN_API_BASE_URL=https://main-api.inkfig-hu.com/api/v1`.
- Deploys `dist/` to the existing `inkfig-user-fe` Worker on every push to `main`.
- Preserves all existing routes, navigation, responsive behavior, localization, loading states, empty states, and error handling.

### Verification

- `[passed] npm test` — 2 tests passed.
- `[passed] npm run build` — strict TypeScript and Vite production build succeeded.
- `[passed] Python YAML parse of .github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- `[passed] npx --yes wrangler@4 deploy --dry-run` — 4 static asset files accepted.
- `[passed] git diff --check`
- `[not run] GitHub Actions production deployment` — requires Cloudflare secrets in the GitHub production environment.

### Deployment

- Configure the GitHub `production` environment with `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`.
- Keep `inkfig-hu.com` associated with the existing `inkfig-user-fe` Worker.
- After setup, every push to `main` deploys the production frontend automatically.
- No migration is required.

### Git

- Branch: `main`
- Commit: `f02331f`
- Push: `successful`

### Notes

The initial workflow run will fail at Cloudflare authentication until both required secrets are configured. Cloudflare Worker static assets and SPA fallback follow the current Wrangler configuration model.
## 2026-09-29 - Review and map the current project foundation

### Request

### Frontend

- The first visit follows the operating-system light/dark preference unless a saved InkFig preference exists.
- Theme changes persist locally under `inkfig.theme` and apply across public and authenticated routes.
- Both themes use colors derived from the official logo; fig burgundy remains reserved for restrained accents and errors.
- Routes, forms, API behavior, localization direction, navigation, loading states, success states, and error handling are otherwise unchanged.

### Verification

- `[passed] npm test` - 5 tests passed.
- `[passed] npm run build` - strict TypeScript checks and Vite production build succeeded.
